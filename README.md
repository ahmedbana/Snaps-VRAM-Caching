# SNAPS VRAM Cache for ComfyUI

A simple VRAM cache system for ComfyUI that allows you to cache models and files directly in GPU VRAM for faster loading and reuse.

## Features

- **No size limits**: Cache models of any size in GPU VRAM
- **Multiple model types**: Supports checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs, ControlNets, CLIP, and diffusion models
- **True GPU VRAM storage**: Models are moved to GPU memory using `.cuda()` for optimal performance
- **Automatic detection**: Automatically detects model types based on file paths
- **Debug logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Cache management**: List and clear cached models

## Nodes

### 1. 🤖 SNAPS VRAM Cache (VRAMCacheNode)

**Main node for loading and caching models in VRAM**

**Inputs:**
- `model_path` (STRING): Path to the model file
- `model_name` (STRING): Optional name for name-based caching (if empty, uses path-based caching)
- `force_reload` (BOOLEAN): Force reload even if already cached (default: False)

**Outputs:**
- `model`: The loaded model data
- `cache_status`: Status message ("LOADED_FROM_CACHE", "LOADED_AND_CACHED", or error)
- `cache_key`: Cache key (model name or file path hash)

**Usage:**
- **Name-based caching**: Provide a `model_name` to cache and load models by name
- **Path-based caching**: Leave `model_name` empty to use traditional path-based caching
- The node will check if the model is already cached in VRAM
- If cached, it returns the cached model instantly
- If not cached, it loads the model and stores it in VRAM for future use

### 2. 🤖 SNAPS Model Loader (ModelLoaderCacheNode)

**Specialized node for caching model data directly in VRAM by name**

**Inputs:**
- `model` (MODEL): The model data to cache
- `clip` (CLIP): The CLIP model data to cache
- `vae` (VAE): The VAE model data to cache
- `checkpoint` (CHECKPOINT): The checkpoint model data to cache
- `lora` (LORA): The LoRA model data to cache
- `controlnet` (CONTROL_NET): The ControlNet model data to cache
- `model_name` (STRING): Name/identifier for the model (required for caching)
- `model_type` (SELECT): Type of model ("auto", "checkpoint", "lora", "vae", "controlnet", "clip", "diffusion")
- `force_reload` (BOOLEAN): Force reload even if already cached (default: False)

**Outputs:**
- `model` (MODEL): The cached model data (if model input was used)
- `clip` (CLIP): The cached CLIP data (if clip input was used)
- `vae` (VAE): The cached VAE data (if vae input was used)
- `checkpoint` (CHECKPOINT): The cached checkpoint data (if checkpoint input was used)
- `lora` (LORA): The cached LoRA data (if lora input was used)
- `controlnet` (CONTROL_NET): The cached ControlNet data (if controlnet input was used)
- `cache_status`: Status message
- `model_type`: The detected/selected model type

**Usage:**
- **Multi-model support**: Accepts all ComfyUI model types (MODEL, CLIP, VAE, CHECKPOINT, LORA, CONTROL_NET)
- **Automatic type detection**: Automatically detects which model type was provided
- **Caches models by name** - use the same `model_name` to retrieve cached models
- **Caches the model data directly in GPU VRAM**
- **If the same model name is already cached, returns it instantly**
- **Useful for caching any type of model that is already loaded in your workflow**

**Example Usage:**
- Connect a CLIP model → cache as "my_clip"
- Connect a VAE model → cache as "my_vae"
- Connect a LoRA model → cache as "my_lora"
- Later use Cached Model Loader to retrieve any of these by name

### 3. 📋 SNAPS Cache Control (VRAMCacheControlNode)

**Node for managing the VRAM cache**

**Inputs:**
- `action` (SELECT): Action to perform ("list_cache", "clear_cache")

**Outputs:**
- `cache_info` (STRING): Information about cached models or status message

**Usage:**
- **list_cache**: Lists all models currently cached in VRAM with their file sizes
- **clear_cache**: Clears all cached models from VRAM

### 4. 📊 SNAPS VRAM Status (VRAMStatusNode)

**Node for checking GPU VRAM usage and cache status**

**Inputs:**
- None

**Outputs:**
- `vram_status` (STRING): Detailed VRAM usage information

**Usage:**
- **Monitor VRAM**: Check total, allocated, reserved, and free GPU memory
- **Verify caching**: See how many models are cached
- **Debug storage**: Confirm models are actually stored in GPU VRAM

### 5. 📥 SNAPS Cached Model Loader (CachedModelLoaderNode)

**Node for loading cached models by name without original model file**

**Inputs:**
- `model_name` (STRING): Name of the cached model to load
- `model_type` (SELECT): Type of model ("auto", "checkpoint", "lora", "vae", "controlnet", "clip", "diffusion")

**Outputs:**
- `model` (MODEL): The cached model data (if cached as model type)
- `clip` (CLIP): The cached CLIP data (if cached as clip type)
- `vae` (VAE): The cached VAE data (if cached as vae type)
- `checkpoint` (CHECKPOINT): The cached checkpoint data (if cached as checkpoint type)
- `lora` (LORA): The cached LoRA data (if cached as lora type)
- `controlnet` (CONTROL_NET): The cached ControlNet data (if cached as controlnet type)
- `cache_status`: Status message
- `model_type`: The actual model type from cache

**Usage:**
- **Load by name only**: No need for original model file
- **Instant retrieval**: Gets model directly from VRAM cache
- **Multi-model support**: Returns the appropriate model type based on what was cached
- **Workflow optimization**: Perfect for reusing cached models in different parts of workflow
- **Error handling**: Returns error if model name not found in cache

**Example Workflow:**
1. Use **🤖 SNAPS Model Loader** to cache a CLIP model with name "my_clip"
2. Use **📥 SNAPS Cached Model Loader** with model_name "my_clip" to retrieve it instantly
3. The CLIP output will contain the cached model, other outputs will be None
4. No need to provide the original model file again

### 6. 🔍 SNAPS Cache Checker (ModelCacheCheckerNode)

**Node for checking if a model is cached in VRAM**

**Inputs:**
- `model_name` (STRING): Name of the model to check in cache

**Outputs:**
- `success_output` (STRING): Success message if model is found in cache (empty if not found)
- `not_found_output` (STRING): Model name if not found in cache (empty if found)

**Usage:**
- **Check cache status**: Verifies if a model is cached in VRAM
- **Conditional workflow**: Use outputs to control workflow branches
- **Success message**: Provides detailed info about cached model (name and type)
- **Pass-through**: Passes model name to next node if not cached

**Example Workflow:**
1. Use **🔍 SNAPS Cache Checker** with model_name "my_model"
2. If found: `success_output` contains "Model 'my_model' (checkpoint) is available in VRAM cache"
3. If not found: `not_found_output` contains "my_model" to pass to loading node
4. Use outputs to control whether to load from cache or load from file

**Conditional Logic:**
- **Model found**: `success_output` has message, `not_found_output` is empty
- **Model not found**: `success_output` is empty, `not_found_output` has model name

## How It Works

1. **Cache Key Generation**: Each model gets a unique cache key based on file path, modification time, and file size
2. **VRAM Storage**: Models are stored directly in GPU VRAM using PyTorch tensors
3. **Singleton Pattern**: Uses a singleton cache manager to ensure consistent state across nodes
4. **Automatic Detection**: Supports both `.safetensors` and regular PyTorch model files
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations are logged for debugging

## Logging

The nodes provide detailed logging for debugging:
- Model loading operations
- Cache hits and misses
- Error messages
- Cache management operations

Logs will appear in your ComfyUI console output.

## Installation

1. Place this folder in your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory
2. Restart ComfyUI
3. The nodes will appear in the "VRAM Cache" category

## Example Workflow

1. Use **SNAPS VRAM Cache** to load your first model - it will be cached in VRAM
2. Use the same node again with the same model path - it will load instantly from cache
3. Use **SNAPS Cache Control** with "list_cache" to see all cached models
4. Use **SNAPS Cache Control** with "clear_cache" to free VRAM when done

## Notes

- Models are cached in GPU VRAM, so they consume GPU memory
- The cache persists until manually cleared or ComfyUI is restarted
- No size limits are enforced - cache as many models as your VRAM allows
- All model types are supported (checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs, etc.) 

## How to Verify VRAM Storage

1. **Use VRAM Status Node**: Add the "📊 SNAPS VRAM Status" node to your workflow
2. **Check before/after**: Run it before and after loading models
3. **Monitor allocated memory**: The "Allocated" value should increase when models are cached
4. **Check cache count**: The "Cached Models" count should match your loaded models

## VRAM Storage Verification

The nodes now properly move models to GPU VRAM:
- **State_dict models**: All tensors are moved to GPU using `.cuda()`
- **Single tensors**: Direct GPU transfer
- **Device checking**: Verifies tensors are actually on GPU before caching
- **Memory tracking**: Logs VRAM usage for debugging
